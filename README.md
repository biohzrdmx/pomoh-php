Translation abstraction library for PO/MO files

Make your projects translatable with the use of PO/MO files with or without `ext-gettext`.

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/pomoh-php` with Composer.

#### Creating a `Translator` instance

Then create a `Translator` instance:

```php
use PoMoh\Translator;

$translator = new Translator($adapter);
```

#### Adapters

You will need to pass an `AdapterInterface` implementation instance; PoMoh includes two:

- `GetTextAdapter` - Use the built-in gettext functions, requires `ext-gettext`
- `MoFileAdapter` - Load and parse MO files in runtime, doesn't require `ext-gettext` but may be a little slower

For example, to use `GetTextAdapter`:

```php
use PoMoh\Translator;
use PoMoh\Adapter\GetTextAdapter;

$adapter = new GetTextAdapter('es_ES', 'pomoh', dirname(__FILE__) . '/lang');
$translator = new Translator($adapter);
```

As you can see you will need to pass the language identifier, the text-domain and the directory where the translations reside, according to the `<directory>/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/<textdomain>.mo` structure, for example:

```
/lang/es_ES/LC_MESSAGES/pomoh.po
/lang/es_ES/LC_MESSAGES/pomoh.mo
/lang/de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/pomoh.po
/lang/de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/pomoh.mo
/lang/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/pomoh.po
/lang/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/pomoh.mo
```

If you can not (or don't want to) use `ext-gettext` you can leverage the `MoFileAdapter`:

```php
use PoMoh\Translator;
use PoMoh\Adapter\MoFileAdapter;

$adapter = new MoFileAdapter('es_MX', dirname(__FILE__) . '/lang');
$translator = new Translator($adapter);
```

This adapter takes only two parameters, the language code and the directory where the translations reside, according to the `<directory>/<language>.mo` structure, for example:

```
/lang/es_ES.po
/lang/es_ES.mo
/lang/de_DE.po
/lang/de_DE.mo
/lang/fr_FR.po
/lang/fr_FR.mo
```

#### Translating strings

Once you have a `Translator` instance just call the `translate` method:

```php
$string = $translator->translate('This is a string');
```

#### Pluralization

The library includes basic support for pluralization through the `pluralize` method:

```php
$string = $translator->pluralize('A fox', '%d foxes', 5);
```

Pluralization rules are either handled by `ngettext` or directly loaded from the MO file; either way they are language dependent.

If no pluralization rules are found the default one will be used (`nplurals=2; plural=n == 1 ? 0 : 1;`).
